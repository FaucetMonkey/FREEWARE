# Freeware Applications from h2ochip.com - Windows 7/10 - CMD Line

WatchNET
A simple and quick way to view your network connections.
WatchNET looks at the external IP adresses every 3 seconds.
On the site there is also a guide, to show you how to edit your host
file and therefore block any website or network that has been connected
to your computer. WatchNET helps you identify these IP addresses and can
also show you which programs are connected to external IP addresses.

IPRecorder

Similar to WatchNET but very concise if needs be. IPRecorder records
all network connections within a certain timeframe.
IPRecorder will ask you "Time between Captures?". You can select any
amount of time right down to 1 second captures. Be warned though 1 second
captures will produce many files in a very short period of time. So be aware
of the folder it is stored in!

Annexe

Annexe is a game to help people get used to some of the CMD Line commands
while giving you points for each one of your actions. Telnet connections
are possible with Annexe and a list of Telnet addresses have been supplied
in the Application.

Alarm Clock

Alarm Clock has been bundled into a zip file because it needs a file called
Alarm.mp3 to operate. You can change the Alarm sound by taking another mp3
and replacing the Alarm.mp3 with your own .mp3 but to do this you must 
rename the new file to Alarm.mp3 or the Application will not know which file
to play.

Guides

There are two guides 'HostFileGuide' and 'StopCortanaGuide'. 

   Host File Guide
   
   A guide to help you block specific sites from your host file, which is the
   file used by Windows to ascertain where to go when sending data to specific
   IP addresses.
   
   Stop Cortana Guide
   
   A guide used to permanently stop the SearchUI.exe application which is 
   commonly known as Cortana.
