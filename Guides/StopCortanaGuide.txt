STOP CORTANA GUIDE
---------------------------------

Cortana uses the program name 'SearchUI.exe' which reloads itself very quickly after using taskkill.
This guide will use a command which moves the folder before cortana can load.

1. Click on your 'Start' menu and scoll down to the bottom. Click on the words 'Windows System>'
    
2. Right Click on 'Command Prompt' and hover over the word 'More'

3. Click on 'Run as Administrator'

4. Copy all of the text below INCLUDING ONE EXTRA LINE below the text. 
    The extra line is very important!


taskkill /f /im SearchUI.exe
move %windir%\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy %windir%\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy.000



5. [don't copy this bit] paste the copied text into the command prompt
     by right clicking in the Command Prompt window 
     or by holding 'CTRL' and pressing 'V'.

     If however, you see a blinking cursor at the end of the line.
     You can try to press 'Return' but you have to be very quick because
     Cortana reloads itself within a few seconds.

     If this doesn't work - Repeat all steps above - But make sure you copy the extra line!

     You can check by typing   netstat -bfo   into the Administrator Command Prompt window.
     A list will appear. If you can see the words [SearchUI.exe], then it hasn't worked.
     if not then Congratulations you stopped Cortana!


6. Reboot your PC and Cortana is gone!
